# Workshop 6
This is your most advanced workshop yet!
Your job is to think about a problem where you would like to fine-tune a model, search for resources for how to fine-tune that model and create / run code for fine-tuning the model.
It’s common that people reuse colab code, so it’s perfectly fine to use code that you find for training your model!
